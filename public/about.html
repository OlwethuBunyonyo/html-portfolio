<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi I'm Olwethu Bunyonyo from Cape Town with a passion for building high-performing digital experiences. Currently, I work as a Funnel Engineer at Blacfox, where I design, develop, and optimize marketing funnels to drive lead generation and conversions. With over four years of experience in web development and software engineering, Iâ€™ve had the opportunity to work on a variety of projects across different industries.</p>
<p>My journey in tech started with an internship at UVU Africa, where I honed my skills in software development. I later joined Younglings Africa as a Software Developer before returning to UVU Africa as a Service Center Agent, gaining valuable customer support experience. I then took on a Junior Software Developer role at WellVersed Hub, where I refined my coding and problem-solving abilities.</p>
<p>With a strong foundation in web development and funnel optimization, I am always eager to learn new technologies and enhance my expertise. My goal is to create seamless digital experiences that drive results and add value to businesses and users alike.</p>
<p>Let's build something great together!</p>
